        <h2>Lessons Learned from Early Career Struggles</h2>
        <h3> The Law School Challenge</h3>
        <p>Completing my law degree at Warwick University was both a rigorous and transformative experience. The intense curriculum, demanding workload and competitive environment often left me feeling overwhelmed. One of the most challenging aspects was the constant comparison with peers. Warwick, renowned for its high academic students, had an environment where everyone seemed to excel with their studies, extra curriculars, hobbies and travels effortlessly. It was as if everyone but me was made to be there. This often made me question my own capabilities and progress.</p>
        <p>Seeing classmates secure prestigious internships and excel academically while I at times struggled to keep up was disheartening. The pressure to perform combined with self-doubt, created a vicious cycle that was hard to break. It took a year and a half to realise that every student's experience is unique and that comparing myself to others was not only unfair but unproductive. Embracing my own path and recognising my strengths, worth and interest was a crucial step in overcoming this.</p>
        <h3> The Battle for Training Contracts</h3>
        <p>After graduating, the struggle didn't end. The next major challenge was securing a training contract, a crucial step for any aspiring solicitor. The legal field is notoriously competitive, and the process of applying for training contracts is exhaustive. Each application requires attention detail, tailored covering letters, and, often, multiple stages of interviews and assesssments.</p>
        <p>Despite putting in this effort, I faced numerous rejections. Each one felt like a setback, casting doubt on my future in law. The rejections were particularly tough to handle because they often came after weeks of anticipation and hope. It was easy to feel discouraged and question whether I was on the right path.</p>
        <h3> Coping with Rejection</h3>
        <p>Dealing with rejection has been a significant part of my life journey, both professionally and personally. Initially, I took rejections personally however, over time, I learned to see these setbacks differently. Rejection is an inevitable part of any career, and in the legal profession, it's a common experience. I realised that each rejection was not a reflection of worth or abilities but rather an opportunity to improve and refine my approach.</p>
        <p>I have started to seek feedback on my applications using LinkedIn connections, colleagues at work and mentors, which provided valuable insights. This feedback has helped me understand what employers were looking for in applications and how I can better present my skills and experiences. Training contract applications have made me more resilient and determined to succeed. It has also made me grateful for the position that I am in as a National Management Trainee. My faith in God has allowed me to be grateful for the answered prayers that I am living in!</p>
        <h3> The Power of Persistence and Prayer</h3>
        <p>Throughout these struggles, my faith in God played a central role. Prayer became a source of strength and comfort during the most challenging times. When faced with rejection and uncertainty, turning to prayer provides me with a sense of peace and reassurance that I am not alone in my journey</p>
        <p>My faith taught me to trust in God's plan, even when the path seemed unclear. Knowing this allowed me to stay anchored and rooted! It also allowed me to remain resilient and persist through setbacks and gave me the courage to keep pursuing my dreams despite the obstacles.</p>
        <p>Prayer, coupled with persistent, became my guiding principles. I learned that perseverance, combined with a deep trust in God, is key to overcoming all struggles including early career struggles.</p>
        <h3>In summary...</h3>
        <p> Reflecting on these early career struggles, I have realised that they were and are not just obstacles but essential experiences that have shaped my personal, professional and spiritual growth. They taught me resilience, the importance of faith, and the value of continuous learning and adaptation. While the path is challenging, ultimately it made me more prepared and confident in myself.</p>
        <p>Embracing these lessons has been crucial in navigating the competitive landscape of law. It also made me grateful for the great career I have as a National Management Trainee and the wealth of personal and professional experience it has given me. It has opened my eyes to many new opportunities and career options and for that I am grateful!</p>
        <p>To anyone facing similar struggles, remember that each challenge is a stepping stone. Stay persistent, seek feedback, and most importantly, believe in your unique journey and trust in God's plan. The lessons learned from these early experiences are invaluable and will serve you well throughout your career... from what I have heard anyways ha!</p>
        <p>Good luck and see you next time!</p>
